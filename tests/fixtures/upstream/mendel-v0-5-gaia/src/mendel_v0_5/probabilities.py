"""Probability calculations for the Mendel v0.5 example package.

The statistical comparison is between two clearly identified alternatives:

* Mendelian segregation: a point hypothesis with a known dominant probability
  ``p = 3/4`` under a single-factor cross.
* A diffuse alternative: the dominant probability ``p`` is unknown and assigned
  a uniform prior on ``[0, 1]``. Its marginal likelihood for any specific
  dominant count ``k`` in ``N`` trials has the closed-form value ``1 / (N + 1)``
  (since ``∫₀¹ C(N, k) p^k (1 - p)^(N - k) dp = 1 / (N + 1)``).

Every number produced by this module is therefore traceable to ``MENDELIAN_P``
and the uniform-over-``p`` reference measure. There is no tolerance window,
no post-hoc ratio band, and no strawman binomial with an arbitrary second
``p``. The point hypothesis is represented by ``Binomial`` and the diffuse
alternative by ``BetaBinomial(n, 1, 1)`` in the example package.
